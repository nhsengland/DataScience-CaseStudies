    <em>Figure 1: Output from the LIME pipeline for a Rosacea face.  3(a) is an example image from the rff-300 dataset; 3(b) is an illustration of 73 superpixels found in the image; 3(c) is an illustration of random perturbations of the superpixels; 3(d) show the top features used in training to created the best performing predictions. </em>
