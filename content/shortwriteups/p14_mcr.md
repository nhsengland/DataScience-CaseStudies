> | "A work experience project investigating the impact of including high-street drug sales data into a prediction model for respiratory deaths.  The technique used to establish the value of these data was model class reliance.  The project demonstrated the methodological approach and it's use for understanding the impact of specific variables on predictive models.  It also showed the value of including these data for the task.  The work continues through the CIVIC-II programme."
