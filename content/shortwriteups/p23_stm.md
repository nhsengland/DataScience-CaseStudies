</p>

The development of an R code for investigating the topics found in free text survey data using a technique that monitors both the content of the responses but also the metadata (e.g. when the response was made, which organisation the response relates to) in order to support the construction of these topics.   

## Results 

The code base has been developed as an open reusable code and being used internally for topic modelling of survey responses.
