Using the SynPath framework we created a diabetes simulation for 800 patients.  These patients could interact within a fictional local area with hospitals providing outpatient and inpatient services, GP practices and community healthcare services.  

## Results 

The project showed how to develop a set of environments, interactions and patients from academic literature, policy, and clinical resources. The model currently runs a simulation that prints outputs of patient records into the console. 

Future collaboration around validation and how to apply learning algorithms are being pursued.
