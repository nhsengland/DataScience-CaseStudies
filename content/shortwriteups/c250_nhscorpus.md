    <em>Figure 1: Open source tools used in each functional setting</em>

We aimed to explore how to build an Open, Representative, Extensible and Useful set of tools to curate, enrich and share sources of healthcare text data in an appropriate manner. 

## Results 

Whilst a tool stack was developed which achieved many of our objectives, the key learning points were around the knowledge gaps which need to be addressed at both a data and tooling level before bringing these data together becomes achievable.
