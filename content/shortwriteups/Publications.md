**Represneting Multimorbid Disease Progressions using directed hypergraphs**

**Jamie Burke**, Ashley Akbari, Rowena Bailey, **Kevin Fasusi**, Ronan A.Lyons, **Jonathan Pearson**, James Rafferty, and **Daniel Schofield**

*To introduce directed hypergraphs as a novel tool for assessing the temporal relationships between coincident diseases,addressing the need for a more accurate 
representation of multimorbidity and leveraging the growing availability of electronic healthcare databases and improved computational resources.*

**Large-scale calibration and simulation of COVID-19 epidemiologic scenarios to support healthcare planning**

**Nick Groves-Kirkby**, Ewan Wakeman, Seema Patel, Robert Hinch, Tineke Poot, **Jonathan Pearson**, Lily Tang, Edward Kendall, Ming Tang, Kim Moore, Scott Stevenson, Bryn Mathias, Ilya Feige, Simon Nakach, Laura Stevenson, Paul O'Dwyer, William Probert, Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, Christophe Fraser

*... We adapted an agent-based model of COVID-19 to inform planning and decision-making within a healthcare setting, and created a software framework that automates processes for calibrating the model parameters to health data and allows the model to be run at national population scale on National Health Service (NHS) infrastructure. ... These simulations were used to support operational planning in the NHS in England, and we present the example of the use of these simulations in projecting future clinical demand during the rollout of the national COVID-19 vaccination programme. ...*

**Primary care coding activity related to the use of online consultation systems or remote consulting: an analysis of 53 million peoples’ health records using OpenSAFELY**

**Martina Fonseca**, Brian MacKenna, Amir Mehrkar, The OpenSAFELY Collaborative, Caroline E Walters, George Hickman, **Jonathan Pearson**, Louis Fisher, Peter Inglesby, Seb Bacon, Simon Davy, William Hulme, Ben Goldacre, Ofra Koffman, Minal Bakhai

*We aimed to explore general practice coding activity associated with the use of online consultation systems in terms of trends, COVID-19 effect, variation and quality.*

**Assessing the value of integrating national longitudinal shopping data into respiratory disease forecasting models**

**Elizabeth Dolan**, James Goulding, Harry Marshall, Gavin Smith, Gavin Ling, Laila Tata

*... We investigated the value of integrating sales of non-prescription medications commonly bought for managing respiratory symptoms, to improve forecasting of weekly registered deaths from respiratory disease at local levels across England, by using over 2 billion transactions logged by a UK high street retailer from March 2016 to March 2020. We report the results from the novel AI explainability variable importance tool Model Class Reliance implemented on the PADRUS model. ...*

**An overview of the National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database: data quality and cohort analysis**

Dominic Cushnan, Oscar Bennett, Rosalind Berka, Ottavia Bertolli, Ashwin Chopra, Samie Dorgham, Alberto Favaro, Tara Ganepola, Mark Halling-Brown, Gergely Imreh, Joseph Jacob, Emily Jefferson, François Lemarchand, **Daniel Schofield**, Jeremy C Wyatt, and NCCID Collaborative

*The National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database (NCCID) is a centralized database containing mainly chest X-rays and computed tomography scans from patients across the UK. ... This article introduces the training dataset, including a snapshot analysis covering the completeness of clinical data, and availability of image data for the various use-cases (diagnosis, prognosis, longitudinal risk). ....*

**Towards nationally curated data archives for clinical radiology image analysis at scale: Learnings from national data collection in response to a pandemic**

Dominic Cushnan, Rosalind Berka, Ottavia Bertolli, Peter Williams, **Daniel Schofield** et al.

*... The National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database, led by NHSX, British Society of Thoracic Imaging, Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust and Faculty, is an example of such a national initiative. Here, we summarise the experiences and challenges of setting up the National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database, and the implications for future ambitions of national data curation in medical imaging to advance the safe adoption of artificial intelligence in healthcare.*
