<h2>Welcome</h2>

We aim to be transparent in our work and code in the open where possible.   Publishing our work has the benefits of:
- Increased awareness of our outputs
- Increased sharing of codes and methods
- Decrease in duplication
- Opportunity for collaboration off the back of seeing something of interest
- Higher quality code and output
- Easier onboarding of new colleagues
- Better recruitment 

This site contains a series of short-form write-ups with links to the published code, technical report and longer-from case study where avaialble.
